			Milwaukee Bucks
		</h1>

		<p>
			The Milwaukee Bucks are an American professional basketball team based in Milwaukee. The Bucks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Central Division. The team was founded in 1968 as an expansion team, and play at the Fiserv Forum. Former U.S. Senator Herb Kohl was the long-time owner of the team, but on April 16, 2014, a group led by billionaire hedge fund managers Wes Edens and Marc Lasry agreed to purchase a majority interest in the team from Kohl, a sale which was approved by the owners of the NBA and its Board of Governors one month later on May 16. The team is managed by Jon Horst, the team's former director of basketball operations, who took over from John Hammond in May 2017.
			<br>
			The Bucks have won one league title (1971), two conference titles (1971 and 1974), and 15 division titles (1971–1974, 1976, 1980–1986, 2001, 2019, 2020). They have featured such notable players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Sidney Moncrief, Oscar Robertson, and Bob Lanier among others. Abdul-Jabbar and Giannis Antetokounmpo have been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the Bucks, for a total of five MVP awards.
