		<h1>
			The Jordan Era
		</h1>

		<p>The Bulls' luck turned for the better after selecting Michael Jordan with the third overall pick in the 1984 NBA Draft.Considered the greatest basketball player of all time by NBA.com, Jordan averaged 28.2 points per game during his first season and received the 1985 NBA Rookie of the Year Award.Jordan could not lead the Bulls past the first round of the playoffs by himself losing to the champion Celtics and in 1987 general manager Jerry Krause acquired Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant at that summer's draft. <br> <br>
			Coach Phil Jackson, an assistant since 1987, succeeded Doug Collins as head coach after that season and in 1991, the team won their first of three consecutive NBA championships by defeating Magic Johnson and the Lakers.Then they won two more consecutive titles in 1992 and 1993 after which Michael Jordan retired. <br> <br>
			Jordan returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and lost in 1995 NBA Playoff despite posting one of his best numbers and close to his playoff average and with the added help of rebounding specialist Dennis Rodman, the team won three more championships from 1996 to 1998.The 1995â€“96 Bulls won a then-record 72 regular season games (out of 82) and are widely regarded as one of the greatest teams in NBA history.
