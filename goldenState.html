			Golden State Warriors
		</h1>

		<p>
			The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city's name, before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971.[a][b] The club plays its home games at the Chase Center.
			<br>
			Nicknamed the Dubs as a shortening of "W's", the Warriors hold several NBA records: best regular season, most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined), and best postseason run. Curry and Thompson are generally considered among the greatest backcourts of all time.[9][10] Only the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics have more NBA championships. The Warriors are the third most valuable NBA franchise and the fifth-highest valued sports franchise in the world, with an estimated value of $4.3 billion.
			<br><br>
			The Warriors have utilized several different logo and uniform designs throughout their history, with the most recent redesign occurring in 2010. However, on June 12, 2019, the Warriors unveiled subtle adjustments to their primary logo, including a new custom font. The club then unveiled six new uniform designs using the newly updated logo on September 17, 2019.
