			Basketrball in its current state
		</h1>

		<p>Fast foward to the present, basketball is one of, if not the biggest sport in the world. With an astonishing 7.5 million viewers over the duration of the NBA finals alone it is without a doubt that basketball is one of the most watched sports. Every era of basketball will always have its reigning king or as it is better known The G.O.A.T (Greatest Of All Time), and now seeing as all previous players have retired it is clear that a new player must step up and take this role, his name of course is Lebron James. 

		Lebron is amongst great players in the Nba and is constantly in competition with them to earn more rings in the finals and the most prestigous award The Most Valuable Player (MVP). The NBA is a very diverse place now with players skill ranging from shooting (Steph Curry) to crazy strength and speed(Giannis Antetokounmpo) to crazy speed and handling with the ball(Kyrie Irving).
